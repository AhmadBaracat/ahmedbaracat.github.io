# Things I wish I did when I first moved to the UK

This will be a live document, which I will keep adding to as I learn.

## Open 2 bank accounts

Open a bank account with a well known "physical" bank (ex: HSBC, Barclays, etc.) as well as a digital bank (Ex: [Monzo](https://join.monzo.com/c/ygpphhl), [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/ahmadb0l!JUL2-22-AR), etc.). The idea is to have your income deposited in the physical bank along with rent and utilities payments whereas the digital bank is to be used for your day-to-day payments. This setup has a couple of benefits:

### Why have a physical bank account with a reputable bank

- Helps later on with getting a mortgage, loan, etc.

- Ability to visit the branch and talk with humans for financial advice

### Why have a digital bank account

- The digital bank account is used as proxy especially in online payments (so that the physical account is not exposed online)
- Since you have to move money from the physical account to the digital, you get more aware about your spending habits as opposed to using a single account
- Digital banks, being the new kid on the block, are usually way ahead of physical banks in terms of online/app features

## Open an ISA account as soon as you start earning

Get into the habit of investing a portion of your monthly income, be it in stocks or other instruments. These small monthly investments will compound over the long run.

## Escape the cities to recharge

It is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day routine and to forget to recharge. In my case, this led several times to mild depressive episodes. Remember that the UK offers easy access (hop on a train and you are good to go) to the countryside and seaside.

## Don't do sports alone all the time

For the most part in the UK, I got used to run alone, which helps in clearing my mind and to listen to my own thoughts patterns. However, very recently, I came to realize that the UK is full of sport clubs (running, cycling, etc.) and it helps, from time to time, to practice in a group. It is also a great way to connect with others who share similar sport habits/passions.
