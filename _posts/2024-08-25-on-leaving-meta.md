# On Leaving Meta

Last Friday was my last day at Meta as a Software Engineer, and soon it will be my last day using Meta products (WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook). Read below for more context 😇.

**Important note:** I'm not trying to start a movement or engage in value signaling. I’m simply sharing why I believe it’s a good idea to boycott Meta products, both as an employee and a user. 

## Story Time
It took me some time to decide if leaving was the right choice, but it ultimately came down to a simple principle: by contributing to Meta, even in a small way, I’m supporting a company whose ethics I don’t align with. For instance, Meta has been known to silence people on its platforms [1] [2] and internally [3] when they voice opposition to its policies or unethical actions. Even though I was well-paid, enjoyed working with my team, had a great work-life balance, and I was working on Whatsapp for business (so far from the 💩), I still couldn’t shake the discomfort of being part of Meta.

Leaving the products I’ve grown accustomed to using is another important step in no longer supporting Meta. When I use WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook, I help the company make money by providing data about myself, my interests, and my connections. This data is then used to attract advertisers. And since I no longer wish to support the company, I believe it’s essential to stop using its products and switch to alternatives. Currently, I am taking gradual steps and documenting them here:

## Workable alternatives 😅
* WhatsApp --> Telegram (use Secret chats for E2E encryption) & Signal
* WhatsApp for business --> Telegram business accounts
* Instagram/Facebook stories --> Telegram Stories
* Facebook groups --> Telegram groups

Signing out of the Meta-verse 😂.
