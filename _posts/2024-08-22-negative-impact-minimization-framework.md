## Draft/Notes
We aren't trying to perfect everything at the same time. One step at a time. Reducing harm is better than keeping it at the same level.

 درء المفاسد أولى من جلب المصالح

Be more mindful of your actions
* Where you spend money matters
* Where/How you spend time matters
* How you earn money matters

In all three above, you end up directly or indirectly supporting the value system of where your money goes, so a bit more mindful of your actions. They matter.

الغاية لا تبرر الوسيلة

* Working for a company that has different value system
    * you are providing value or making them bigger
* Income/corporate tax
    * going to countries or to things you don't approve of
* VAT tax
* Council Tax

You're refining your thoughts into a framework that emphasizes the importance of being mindful about financial and professional decisions, particularly in terms of their ethical implications. Here's a more polished version of what you're aiming to communicate:

**Negative Impact Minimization Framework**

This framework encourages incremental progress in reducing harm and making ethical decisions, especially regarding money and time. The goal isn't to achieve perfection immediately but to take meaningful steps toward minimizing negative impacts.

**Guiding Principle:**
  
- **درء المفاسد أولى من جلب المصالح** ("Averting harm takes precedence over seeking benefits"): This principle underlines the importance of reducing harm even before pursuing potential benefits. Being more mindful of where and how you allocate resources can significantly impact the world around you.

**Core Concepts:**

1. **Where You Spend Money Matters:** Every dollar spent is a vote of support for the values of the businesses and services you choose. Being selective about your spending can help align your financial actions with your ethical beliefs.

2. **Where/How You Spend Time Matters:** Your time, like your money, is a resource that supports the values of the activities and organizations you engage with. Choose wisely where you invest your time to ensure it aligns with your values.

3. **How You Earn Money Matters:** The way you earn a living has broader implications. If your work contributes to the success of an organization whose values differ from yours, you are indirectly supporting those values. Reflect on the alignment between your work and your ethics.

**Ethical Considerations:**

- **Working for a Company with Different Values:** When your employer's values conflict with your own, your work could be contributing to their growth and influence. It's important to consider the long-term implications of this alignment.

- **Taxes and Ethical Choices:**
    - **Income/Corporate Tax:** Be mindful that taxes paid can support governments or initiatives that may not align with your values.
    - **VAT and Council Tax:** Consider the ethical implications of where your taxes are directed and how they are used.

**Philosophical Underpinning:**

- **الغاية لا تبرر الوسيلة (The Ends Do Not Justify the Means):** This principle reminds us that ethical conduct should be maintained at every step, regardless of the intended outcome. The means by which you achieve your goals should align with your values.


This framework highlights the significance of taking thoughtful, measured actions that gradually reduce harm and better align your financial and professional choices with your ethical beliefs.
