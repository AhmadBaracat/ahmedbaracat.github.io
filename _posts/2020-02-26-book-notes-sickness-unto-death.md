# (Book Notes) The Sickness unto Death

## Quotes:  

“The believer possesses the eternally certain antidote to despair, viz. possibility; for with God all things are possible every instant. This is the sound health of faith which resolves contradictions. The contradiction in this case is that, humanly speaking, destruction is certain, and that nevertheless there is possibility. Health consists essentially in being able to resolve contradictions.”

“the more the self knows, the more it knows itself”

“if by not venturing at all in the highest sense (and to venture in the highest sense is precisely to become conscious of oneself) I have gained all earthly advantages…and lose my self! What of that?”

## Questions
* What is the will?
* Relation between will, imagination, self, spirit, soul?
