# On fighting Distraction

Other keywords: phone-dependence / phone addiction / interruption addiction

Figured out that most of the below and more are amazingly articulated in [Center for Humane Technology's "Take Control" article](https://www.humanetech.com/take-control).

*   Processes
    *   remove apps
    *   deactivate social accounts
    *   add screen time limits
    *   activate Do Not Disturb modes that donâ€™t allow any form of instant notification, even multiple successive calls
        *   you will be surprised by how infrequently or rarily something truly urgent needs you and how ppl will get very creative in reaching you if absolutely needed
    *   disable unuseful notifications from appearing on home screen
    *   remove irrelevant and unuseful apps from screens
    *   declutter/limit the number of apps pages
    *   limit number of apps/icons per screen
    *   disable email notifiactions from social accounts (if necessary, leave on DMs notifiactions)
    *   use social accounts from the browser vs. dedicated app
    *   write through proxy services (ex: Buffer to post on social media, if absolultely needed)
*   Go out without your phone for long walks to explore, try new things
*   Be unreachable
*   Go to a book store and read table of contents, find a section that catches your curiosity and start reading it
