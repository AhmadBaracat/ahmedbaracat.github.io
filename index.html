      More about me (the long version 😅)
    </h2>
    <p>
      🚀 I believe that startups are the key drivers of economic growth and innovation. I am currently trying to create a sustainable company where I can help create value and wealth for myself and others. Read <a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">Paul Graham</a> and <a href="https://nav.al/rich">Naval Ravikant</a> articles to understand what I mean by wealth. My 2 focuses are building <a href="https://www.pricelessai.com/">Priceless AI</a> and exploring AgriTech.
    </p>

    <p>
      💻 I used to work at Amazon (Dynamic Advertising & Alexa) where my focus was on machine learning engineering and computer vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      👾 I enjoy training and deploying computer vision deep learning models for classification, object detection and segmentation ranging from multi-band Satellite images and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images to customer facing images for Amazon Alexa.
    </p>

    <p>
      ❤️ My interests include entrepreneurship, education, design, engineering, economics and cognitive psychology
    </p>
    🕹 10 years ago, I created games for Windows Phone (I bet on Windows Phone and obviously lost 😅). Along with my brother, who created the visual designs, we created 5+ games. Some were featured by Microsoft in 150+ countries. <a href="/apps">Check them out</a>.

      🇪🇬 I am from Egypt where I lived in Cairo for 26 years and I have been living in the UK 🇬🇧 (Edinburgh & London) for the past few years.

      🎹 I played the Piano seriously (thank you Mami) from age 7-19 (earned Trinity College London grade 8) and casually since then. You can listen to me playing on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ahmadbaracat">SoundCloud</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfiRwmXxK27stnypbsVZyq_V3SVSlk8Iz">Youtube</a>.

    <p>
      🎾 I played Tennis seriously (thank you Papi) from age 7-16 and casually since then.
    </p>

    <p>
      🏃🏻‍♂️I love to run and usually run ~6km in 30 mins and occasionally longer distances.
    </p>

    <p>
      📚 I love to read. I keep track of the books I read <a href="/#reading">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      👨🏻‍🏫 I love to teach. I created data science lectures in Arabic. You can check <a href="/courses">their page</a>. They are available on SkillShare and Youtube.
    </p>

    <p>
      ✏️ I enjoy writing essays. You can read them on <a href="https://blog.barac.at/archive">my blog</a>.

      🦦 My favorite animals are beavers as they have strong family bonds and their engineering work can literally change the landscape. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/eQHADullAzk">this National Geographic documentary</a> to learn more.
